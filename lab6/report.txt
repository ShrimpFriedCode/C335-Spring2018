1. printf debugging is helpful as you can easily see what data is being fed to a program, and how that data is being interpreted.

2. spiReadWrite is called inside a higher level peripheral function because lcdWrite needs to send the data of what pixels need to be manipulated, and that data needs to be stored in the lcd's register. 

3. LCD_CS_DEASSERT() deselects the LCD as the current SPI peripheral. This is impoertant because if we didn't deselect the LCD, we wouldn't be able to communicate with any other SPI device attached. 

4. drawChar uses a for loop to draw each pixel of a char. in the loop, the value of the given character in gldfont.c is assigned to a var. The for loop reads this var (which is a byte of binary data), and if there is a one in the i, j position, a pixel is drawn at i, j.

5. Honestly didnt have time to figure out salae. I'll pop by office hours next week to figure it out.

6. I had difficulties figuring out how to realiably display a fluctuating graph without having shutter issues with the screen constantly redrawing. I was able to solve this by determining and comparing the size of our current graph vs the last displayed graph. If our current our current one was shorter, I redrew only the pixels that didn't represent our current graph's data, instead of redrawing the whole graph.
