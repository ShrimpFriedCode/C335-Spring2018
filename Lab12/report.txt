1. the peripheral base address is significant as it points to the very begininng of the peripheral in the system memory, allowing us to interact with the device.

2. It was necessary to enable incrementing as was donein the step as it properly syncs up the devices to the clock

3. this line of code holds the function until DMA is no longer communicating data, so we don't get ahead of ourselves and fail to properly send commands

4. For transfers less than 4 bytes, one should not use the xchng function as it wates space, as it sends multiple 16bit elements. With such a small transfer, you'll waste a lot of space if you use such a big function for a small ammount of data. 

5.It is important for the DMA controller and audio player to work on different portions of the audiobuf for a number of reasons. Firstly, if you have to devices doing the same work, you are being ineffiecent and wasting program time/resources. Secondly, you could have issues where if both devices are on the same buffer, there could be latency in between buffers as the program has to begin processing a whole new buffer one after the other.

6.I learned the importance of timing and how WAV files are communicated to the system, and how audio controllers handle music data.

7. I had difficulties fully completing this lab as I did not have a lot of the prvious lab material done, making it difficult to progress. I got stuck implementing interrupts, and could not progess from there.
