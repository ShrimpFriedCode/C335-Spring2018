1. 3 connections are required for UART communication; TX, RX and GND. 

2. Alternate functions on GPIO pins allow us to use the pins for a variety of different purposes. Wtih alternate functions, the same could be responsible for either power, TX/RX, etc. This allows us to have fewer pins on the board. 

3. Baud rate is thew rate at which signals are transmitted from one device to another

4. stubs allows us to use code that is not system dependent. Printf wouldn't work on the board without it as the STM32 does not have access to the standard C libraries, and some C libraries aren't compadible with the system architecture to begin with. Newlib ports these libs so that we casn use them on whatever system we want. 

5. This is extracredit, but I'll answer the first part of the question; SLA would be helpful when trying to determine if two devices are communicating properly, and sending the right signals at the right rate. 

6. I Learned about serialT as a method to monitor communication on serial devices. I had some difficulties in this lab, although it was not due to the work. I discovered embarrassingly late that I was using the spring 2017 repo, and not the 2018 repo. This obviously led to some unnecessary complications with missing/modified files and different code. I was able to solve this however, and I was able to continue on with the lab work.
