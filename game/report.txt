As stated in final_project.txt, I did all of the tasks for this project (which is why its kinda bad). The first major task was to get the correct 'ball' shape on the screen using push color. this allows for a graphical representation in lieu of the SD card. The second major task was being able to move said ball around using the accel data on the device. I was able to do this by bringing over old code to calculate pitch and roll. Said values were then added to the coords of the ball, effetively moving the draw window at a reliable rate. Next, was to calculate wall collisions. This was done by passing the ball coords to a checker function which checked if the coords were greater than the total width/height, or less than 0. If so, it would correct these values to rest the ball on the wall. In a similar vein, checking goal collisions was done by passing the ball coords and goal coords. if an absolute collision is detected, game state is changed. Lastly, the timer var was recorded then displayed on the ending screens, which repeat the game loop once the user button is pressed.

Technically, I encountered many difficulties due to my own procrastination. I failed to properly setup the SD card, hence lack of SD and audio. The I2C link between the nunchuk and accel was also giving me too much issue for me to reliably debug both in the short ammount of time I alloted to myself. Therefore, I was only able implement half of the required peripherals. 

I would definetly take more time to get the SD card working could I do this over. I was swamped by many other final projects, and wasn't able to allot enough time for this project towards the end.
