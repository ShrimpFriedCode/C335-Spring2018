Q1. The accelerometer/magnetometer has 14 pins, they are as follows:

1. Vdd_IO
2. SCL
3. SDA
4. INT2
5. INT1
6. C1
7. GND
8. Reversed
9. DRDY
10. Reversed
11. Reversed
12. SETP
13. SETC
14. Vdd

Electrical Characteristics:

Vdd required: 2.5V

The accelerometer/magnetometer is sitting at the top right of the board.

Q2. We need to write before we read because we need to apply settings to the device. The code below is doing just that; choosing and applying settings to the device to select what exactly is running on the chip and how. 

Q3. these lines from the read function pull data from the register and assign/clean the raw data to a new array.
